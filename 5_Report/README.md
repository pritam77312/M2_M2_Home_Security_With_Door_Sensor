# Abstract:
Door sensor for security purposes are widely used now. An door sensor based on electrical and electronics circuit technology is used to develop the security system as well as automatic light switching system. This security system with door sensor which could benefit every safer environment and single individual. Furthermore, the system is developed with safety environment when switching ON or OFF the light during the room door open or door close.Basically, this system is designed for security purpose to secure the home.

The system which  is the  designed Home Security using door sensor is designed considering some factors such as  economy, availability of  components and efficiency, compatibility, portability and also durability.The  general  operation  of  this  system  and performance is dependent on the opening and closing of the door.

# Description:-
Here is a Project developed as mini project in embedded c as Home Security With Door Sensor
Door sensors are an essential component of your home security system
In this mini project you can get status of our Home Door which is closed or open
If the Led connected to atmega port is high means if Led is Flashing then you can get the idea about status of Door i.e our door is open
similarly, If the Led connected to atmega controller port is low means Led is not Flashing then you can get that the Door is Closed
this is all becoz of I have made a system that if Door is closed then there will be no supply to the Led so Led will not glow
similarly for open of door there will be supply of 5V that i have made so that Led will glow there
so this is how you can get status of your Home Door with this Embedded project
                 

# Requirements:--

# 4'W 1'H:-
  ## What :- 
       Door sensors are an essential component of your home security system: they let you know about the Door which is open or closed.
       
  ## Why :- 
       In order to get door status that if door is open then we can assume that someone is entering or going out.
       
  ## When :- 
       Anytime we can use this sensors as this are automatic door sensors which are connected to door to get the status of door.
       
  ## Who :- 
       All the peoples those who want to keep their Home secure With this Door Sensors which are easy to Install.
       
  ## How :-
      One piece attaches on the door frame, and the other attaches parallel to the first piece on the door itself.
      these two parts creats close circuit when door is close and when door is open it will switch circuit.

# SWOT Analysis :-

 
  ## Strength:-
     1.Energy savings
     2.Lesser maintenance.
     3.Assorted costs.
  ## Weakness:-
     1.Possibilities of Damaging the switch may wear out
     2.May Run out of batteries
  ## Opportunities:-
     1.Advancements in Technology
     2.Secureness
  ## Threats:-
     1.Incomplete home coverage
     2.Installing incompatible security products
     3.System Stability
